# Newsroom Theme

This a simple, minimalistic theme, which is inspired by [Apple's Newsroom page](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/). You won't find a single reference of monolithic libraries such as `jquery`, `bootstrap`, `bulma`.

All the templates herein use *grid css*, *flexbox* & *vanilla js*. You may,however, proceed and tweak everything as you wish.
